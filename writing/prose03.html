"Just be."
</p>
<p>
	My professor seems to be staring through my chest and into my heart, which had spent the last few weeks exerting much more effort than usual. It wasn't alone. My mind had been circling and tripping over itself for some time, and it was beginning to affect other parts of my body. The gory details aren't necessary, but suffice it to say, my insides were not in any sort of state that could be mistaken for "just being."
</p>
<p>
I wasn't sure what she meant by this phrase, what it could possibly mean. Of course, "just be," no sweat. I do that every day, exist. So I know how to "be." 
</p>
<p>
But then, while turning it over in my head a few more times, I become fixated on the word "just." What does that entail?
</p>
<p>
To "just" be, I have to cut out everything else. I need to hit the mute button on external stimuli, turn off the thought processes that don't aid in producing clarity, and afford myself the space to ignore the inconsequential urgencies that fray my nerves and pressurize my skull. But beyond that, in order to "just be" I need to know who I am at the most basic level, and that is not a simple task.
</p>
<p>
What defines me? What are my atomic, indivisible units? A bag of meat and bone and fluid? How would something of that composition be in its most restful state? Coprse-like I imagine. A creation of a benevolent God? I wonder what a still, silent existence confident of that fact might manifest itself as. Is it too high-level to consider myself a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a friend, a student, an acquaintance, and any other station I have been placed in or chosen? Each of those requires certain quantities of mental cycles to rationalize and understand. Wouldn't it be wrong to simple accept the multitude of facets of me without further reasoning?
</p>
<p>
	I catch myself briefly to remind my conscience that these are all important questions and issues, but maybe it would be alright to ponder them individually, temporarily, between periods of existential contentment. I commend myself on a great point, a small victory. But surely some conclusion must be drawn on each front to allow such quiet. An open question is the archenemy of solitude, and a feeling deep in the gut without concrete cause must be attended to!
</p>
<p>
	I would love to have the confidence to "just be," but I'm afraid I don't. It's not possible for this version of me, not feasible at the intersection of my spirit and this moment in time. Any attempt results in a worsening of the confusion, a frantic scramble back to the safety and comfort of unconsidered existence. Someday I will revisit this place, this internal cell, to try to free myself. But not today.
</p>
<p>
	I open my eyes from a long blink and stare back down at the quiz on my desk as my professor repeats herself.
</p>
<p>
	"The answer to number ten is just B, Aristotle. Any questions before we move on to today's lecture?"
