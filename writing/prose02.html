Two days ago, a college classmate of mine passed away. I didn't hear about it until today, but I knew he had recently been diagnosed with cancer. 
</p>
<p>
He was the same age as me. "Was." That's not a verb suited to someone my age when applied to the whole person. "Was," at my age, is supposed to describe change. He was shorter back then. He was slimmer. He was less outgoing. It's not supposed to be proper grammar in any and all situations. He is taller. He is bulkier. He is more comfortable in his own skin. You're supposed to be able to use "is" at 26, and you're supposed to be able to use "will be."
</p>
<p>
He leaves behind a wife, a newborn, a whole life. And not one of those lives that can be fully summed up by those being verbs. He was truly living. He seemed to have things figured out years before most anyone else. I never talked to him about love or faith, but I didn't really need to. His life overflowed with both. Calm, collected, warm, friendly, kind. WAS calm, collected, warm, friendly, kind. Shit.
</p>
<p>
This was no drawn out, years long battle. Where a full life stood just then, now a void. There are situations where one can honestly say that "He's in a better place now." without patronizing his or her own emotions, but it takes more faith than one can muster on reflex to believe that now. That faith takes time and proving, over and over. </p>
<p>
Thankfully that kind of faith is not required of us, at least not on our own strength.
