We, as people and spirits, are here, alive, until we are not. Barring some great metaphysical twist, there is no partial inhabitance of our human form. The God of the universe places us one by one into earthly shapes and plucks us one by one (though maybe not in the sequence or timing we would prefer) back into the realm of angels. The portals of birth and death are neither transparent nor bidirectional, and therein lies the root of the need for faith. We cannot prove that which our faith posits, at least not to the rigorous scientific standards of this age. However, we can take full advantage of the confidence our faith gives us that as certainly as our passage into existence, through birth, exposed us to the inexpressible beauties and joys of earthly life, so too will our passage through death into new life exceed any possible expectation.
